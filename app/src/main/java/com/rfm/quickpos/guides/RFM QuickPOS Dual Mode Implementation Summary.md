# RFM QuickPOS Dual Mode Implementation Summary

## What's Implemented

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive dual-mode system for RFM QuickPOS that supports both Cashier (staff-facing) and Kiosk (customer-facing) modes. Here's what we've created:

### Core Architecture

1. **Mode Definition**: Created a `UiMode` enum with `CASHIER` and `KIOSK` options
2. **Mode Management**: Implemented `UiModeManager` to handle mode switching and persistence
3. **Feature Flags**: Added `FeatureFlagManager` to control which features are available in each mode
4. **Dual Navigation**: Built separate navigation graphs for each mode

### Kiosk-Specific Features

1. **Attract Screen**: Created a welcoming start screen with auto-reset capability
2. **Automatic Reset**: Added `InactivityManager` and detection components to return to the attract screen after inactivity
3. **Physical Lockdown**: Implemented kiosk mode (lock task) and system bar handling
4. **Simplified UI**: Created kiosk-specific versions of key screens with larger touch targets and streamlined workflows:
    - Kiosk Catalog Screen
    - Kiosk Cart Screen
    - Kiosk Payment Screen
    - Kiosk Payment Success Screen

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Mode Selection**: Updated PIN login to determine mode based on the entered PIN
2. **UI Adaptations**: Made kiosk UI more customer-friendly with:
    - Larger touch targets
    - Center-aligned text
    - Simplified workflows
    - Clearer instructions
3. **Auto-Print**: Added automatic receipt printing simulation with countdown to return to attract screen

### Integration Components

1. **Inactivity Detection**: Created components to detect and respond to user inactivity
2. **Feature Flag Provider**: Added composition local providers to access feature flags throughout the UI
3. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive implementation guide for developers

## How to Test

1. **Mode Switching**:
    - Enter PIN 1234 to access Cashier Mode
    - Enter PIN 5678 to access Kiosk Mode

2. **Kiosk Flow**:
    - Start at the attract screen
    - Browse products in the simplified catalog
    - Add items to cart
    - Proceed to checkout
    - Choose payment method
    - See payment success and auto-return to attract screen

3. **Auto-Reset**:
    - Leave any kiosk screen inactive for 2 minutes
    - It should automatically return to the attract screen

4. **Manager Access**:
    - In kiosk mode, tap the settings icon in the top right of the attract screen
    - Enter manager PIN (1234) to exit kiosk mode

## Future Considerations

This implementation is ready to be connected to a backend API when available. The current PIN-based mode selection should be replaced with:

1. Reading device serial number
2. Calling backend API to get device configuration
3. Caching the response for offline use

The architecture is designed to make this transition seamless when the backend is ready.
